# unpaws

**Paw now, soar later!**

**unpaws** is an innovative app designed to match students with companies for apprenticeships and internships. Our goal is to help students gain hands-on experience and kickstart their careers.

## About the App

unpaws connects ambitious students with exciting opportunities in various industries. By facilitating these connections, we aim to:

- Provide students with real-world work experience
- Help companies find fresh talent
- Bridge the gap between academic learning and professional skills
- Give a platform Student-focused to help them in a difficult time of searching

Our mascot, a clever and curious raccoon, represents the spirit of exploration and adaptability that we encourage in our users. (Might exist one day, might never see the light. Nobody knows!)

# Student Apprenticeship Job-Board

This project is a basic React SaaS application for managing a fictive students apprenticeship job-board. It provides :

- An admin dashboard to manage student/professionals profiles, job listings, and company information.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Next.js (public app)
- TypeScript
- Material-UI (admin, getting rid of)
- Axios for API calls
- React Router for navigation
- Vite as the build tool and development server (admin)
- Docker for containerization
- Nginx for reverse proxy
- mongodb for Databases
- node.js Express for the api definitions and routing

### Potential Future Technologies

- Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration testing
- Cypress for end-to-end testing
- Storybook for component documentation and testing
- React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- Firebase or AWS Amplify for authentication and backend services (not sure yet)
